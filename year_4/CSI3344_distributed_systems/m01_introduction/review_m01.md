# Review questions

1. Heterogeneity applies to
  - Networks
  - Hardware
  - OS
  - Programming languages
  - Implementation by different developers
2. What is the role of middleware in a distributed system?
  - Software that connects different kinds of applications
  - Provides distributed transparency to connected applications
  - Masks heterogeneity
  - Provides programming model to developers
3. What is meant by transparency, and give examples of different types of transparency
  - Concealment of separate components which make up a distributed system and is presented as a single system
  - Mobility
    - Movement of resources and clients without affecting operation
  - Performance
    - Allow reconfiguration of system to improve performance as loads vary
  - Scaling
    - Allows system and applications to expand in scale without change to system structure or application algorithms
4. What is an open distributed system and what benefits does openness provide?
  - Offers components that can easily be used by or integrated into other systems
  - Advantages
    - Interoperability
    - Composability
    - Extensibility
5. Describe precisely what is meant by a scalable system, and what techniques can be used to achieve scalability?
  - Can adapt to load placed upon it by users and/or other systems
  - By expanding the number of resources available to it
  - Without change to system structure or application algorithms
  - Techniques
    - Hiding communication latency
    - Partitioning and distributing
    - Replication/caching
