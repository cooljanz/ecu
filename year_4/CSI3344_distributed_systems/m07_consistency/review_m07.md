# Review questions: Consistency

1. What is the purpose of data replication?
  -  Increase reliability and performance
  -  Scale the system in number of servers/users and geographical areas
2. What are the two major processes on data?
  - Read
  - Write
3. Explain why a write operation must leave a value to the data item after its operation finishes
  - Because it changes the data
4. Explain why a read operation is not required to leave a value to the data item it viewed
  - Because it only reads the data, not change it
5. What is a consistency model
  - An agreement or contract between processes and the data store
  - Restricts processes to follow certain rules that make the data store work correctly
  - Restrictions determine different consistency models
6. In the necessary condition of strict consistency, which statement implies the need for a global physical clock for this model?
  - Any read on a data item `x` returns a value corresponding to the result of the **most recent** write on `x`
7. Describe the necessary conditions for sequential, causal, and FIFO consistency models
  - Sequential
    - The result of any execution is the same as if the read/write operations by all processes on that data store were executed in the same sequential order
  - Causal
    - Writes that are potentially causally related must be seen by all processes in the same order
    - Concurrent writes may be seen in different orders on different machines
  - FIFO
    - Writes done by a single process are seen by all other processes in the order in which they were issued
    - Writes from different processes may be seen in a different order by different processes
    - All writes generated by different processes are concurrent
    - Single FWIFRO
8. In the second and third examples for causal consistency, what actually differentiates them from each other?
  - The first example has a potential causal relationship between `W_1(x)a` and `W_2(x)b` via `R_2(x)a`
  - The second example does not have any causal relationships and both write operations are concurrent
