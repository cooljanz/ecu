# Review questions: Communications 1

1. Protocols are often constructed in the form of layers
  - True
2. Why is OSI referred as a reference model
  - It identifies various levels involved
  - Standardised names
  - Points out which level should do which job
  - Describes how something should be implemented
  - Not the implementation itself
3. Name the seven layers of the OSI model
  - Application
    - Meet the communication requirements of specific applications
    - Often defining the interface to a service
  - Presentation
    - Transmit data in a network representation that is independent of the representations used in individual computers
    - Encryption also performed in this layer if required
  - Session
    - Reliability and adaptation measures performed
      - Detect failures
      - Auto recovery
  - Transport
    - Lowest level where messages (not packets) are handled
    - Messages are addressed to ports attached to processes
    - Protocols in this layer may be connection oriented or connectionless
  - Network
    - Transfer data packets between computers in a specific network
    - In WAN or internetwork, this involves generation of a route passing through routers
    - In LAN, no routing is required
  - Data link
    - Responsible for transmission of packets between nodes that are directly connected by a physical link
    - In WAN, transmission is between
      - Pairs of routers
      - Routers and hosts
    - In LAN, transmission is between
      - Any pair of hosts
  - Physical
    - The circuits and hardware that drive the network
    - Transmits sequences of binary data by analogue signalling
      - On cable circuits with electric signals
        - Amplitude
        - Frequency modulation
      - On fire optic circuits
        - Light signals
      - Other electromagnetic signals
        - Radio
        - Microwave circuits
- What does the data link layer do
  - Responsible for transmission of packets between nodes that are directly connected by a physical link
  - In WAN, transmission is between
    - Pairs of routers
    - Routers and hosts
  - In LAN, transmission is between
    - Any pair of hosts
- What does the physical layer do
  - The circuits and hardware that drive the network
  - Transmits sequences of binary data by analogue signalling
  - On cable circuits with electric signals
    - Amplitude
    - Frequency modulation
  - On fire optic circuits
    - Light signals
  - Other electromagnetic signals
    - Radio
    - Microwave circuits
- By adopting standards what can we achieve in networked communication
  - Heterogeneity
- The internet communication model is a de facto standard
  - False
