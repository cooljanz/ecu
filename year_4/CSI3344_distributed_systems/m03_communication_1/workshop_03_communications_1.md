# Workshop 03: Communications 1

Martin Ponce 10371381

## Question 1:

Performance efficiency is traded off for the protocol layering approach which simplifies and generalizes the software interfaces to access the communication services of networks.

## Question 2:

Transport level communication services are often inappropriate for building distributed applications because of their lack of distribution transparency.

## Question 3:

Multicast belongs to the middleware layer. There are many use cases for reliable multicast, and desired "reliability" features which are application specific. Implementation at the middleware layer allows features to be delivered without compromising standards of lower layers.
